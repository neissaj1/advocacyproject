      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Problem?</h2>
      <p>  A part of the American Dream is to own property, but for marginalized communities that is an uncompromising dream to achieve.  With bank pre-approvals, down payments, credit scores, and more, low-income families find it extremely difficult to gain property they can call their own. </p> 
       <p> 
        Nationally, there is an affordable housing crisis as a result of low government funding, low wages, increased gentrification, and more.  
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
      <p>Homelessness and housing instability in America have surged as the cost of living has risen, putting a strain on underprivileged populations.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Where else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
      <p>Affordable housing issues today can be connected back to the post-World War II housing and family boom, which resulted in the new American norm of a nuclear family and living in suburban homes.  As white families moved to identical-looking homes in the suburbs and gained more economic stability, marginalized communities were disproportionately denied access to these services, resulting in further segregation and undesirable living conditions.
